# Group-Calendar-Management-System

This is a project that I worked on CSC 340: Ethics & Software Engineering with 2 other people.

This code was written by Quentin Patterson, Adam Clark, and Christopher Witt.

The goal of this project was to make a calendar event system that revolves around a individual event calendars, group meetings, and meeting rooms.

In this role I acted as team-leader, and I divided tasks between Mr. Clark, Mr. Witt, and I so that I could use all of our code to create a finished project.

NOTE: THIS PROJECT DOES NOT WORK AS-IS. This depends on a database server, and code must be changed to fit a different database server.
