# Group-Calendar-Management-System

This is a project that I worked on CSC 340: Ethics & Software Engineering with 2 other people.

This code was written by Quentin Patterson, Adam Clark, and Christopher Witt.

The intention of this project was to make a calendar event system that revolves around a individual event calendars, group meetings, and meeting rooms.
